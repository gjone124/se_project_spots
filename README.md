**Intro**

This is the 4th project for the Triple Ten Software Engineering program. It's associated with Sprint 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

For the 1st stage of the project in Sprint 3 (Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts), we were given an adaptive web design through figma.com and we were told to replicate the web page from scratch using HTML and CSS.

Spots is an image sharing website. There is a user profile with an avatar and a grid of photographs with a short description.

This project is our first project to use responsive design where the screen changes as it gets smaller or bigger.
